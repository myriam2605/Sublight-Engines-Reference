# cdbx-frontend-sublight-engines

Sublight Engines One-Pager for Codeboxx's Front-End Program

## Basic version

It is the most simple and basic structure needed to achieve the proper result. There are many ways to structure the website elements, no developers will work the same. This version is a simple blueprint of how it should be organized. Keep in mind there are a few advanced concept in my stylesheet like Flexbox. One could argue that it is part of the responsabilities of the student and learner to research such concept or at least try to understand how HTML elements interact with each other and how positioning works. There are a lot of resources on the web.

## Optimized version

This version is what an experienced Front-end developer will try to achieve. Using all modern approaches and practices to achieve the best result.

# Convert Image to WebP Format (Not required)

In a Terminal (MacOs should already have this built-in, search Google for Windows procedure):

`cwebp -q 80 assets/image-name.jpg -o assets/image-name.webp`

## Notes - Not mandatory but good practices

- Converting images to next-gen webP format
- Preload important assets in the HEAD element
- Minifying the CSS file
- Versioning the assets file in LINK and SCRIPTS
